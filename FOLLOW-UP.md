# General:

### Q) How long, in hours, did you spend on the test?
### 24 hours

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
### I would use bpk components instead of html tags, and make the pager more like the real one on Skyscanner.com.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
### I am proud of the frontend (styling, validation, flight results) because it looks a lot like original Skyscanner web.
### I am not very proud of the pager, but still I would like to name it.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
### I have spent a little bit longer than half of the time on building user interface. Nothing was so difficult.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test or our API, we'd love to hear them.
### I find it really interesting to fetch data from real live-price api and work on the design of the world's best travel meta-search website.
### If the test design is updated with current version of Skyscanner.com, including other features, it would be more interesting and challenging.
### As I have tested in recent few days, your API is great. 
### Overall, it is really fun to work on online travel website. Thank you so much for this test.
